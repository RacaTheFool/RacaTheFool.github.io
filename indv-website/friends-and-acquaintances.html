        <p>Making friends can be difficult. The hardest part can be just meeting people in the first place, and then finding a way to spend time with them can still be almost impossible. That's why it's important to reach out of yourself and go to social gatherings. Too often we wait for others to walk up to us and have them not only force an interaction, but then we expect them to be the one to invite us to go do something. Be the person that you're waiting for and do what you would expect them to do! At the very least be friendly with others. If you don't know where to meet people, just become friends with your co-workers. If you don't have co-workers, get a job (we care about you enough to say it twice, <em>get a job!</em>). As you interact with others, don't make it hard for them to talk to you, you'll just push them away. Also, make sure that you have good hygiene (no one wants to be around someone smelly and gross). </p>
