        <h3>In the Beginning...</h3>
        <p>From the start of all creation, man has wanted to know if he wasn't alone in the universe. Ironically, we struggle to even socialize amongest ourselves, so maybe we should figure that out first. That's why we at <em>Friends and Fist-Bumps</em> seek to help the world become a more socially connected place! </p>
        <p>As individuals we all have our weaknesses and strengths, and some of the most frustrating weaknesses can be those that affect our ability to interact with others or even feel good about ourselves. That's why our <a href="#the-founder">founder</a>, Dylan Furrows, decided to create <em>Freinds and Fist-Bumps</em> in the first place. Along with the help of our wonderful <a href="#our-employees">employees</a>, we plan to change the world one <a href="#our-customers">individual</a> at a time. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="the-founder">The Founder</h3>
        <p>Dylan Furrows is a local to Rexburg, Idaho. He is currently a student at the local college, BYU-I, and plans to become a Software Engineer. He is active in his faith, and enjoys serving others around him. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="our-employees">Our Employees</h3>
        <p>Only those who exemplify friendship are hired here at <em>Friends and Fist-Bumps</em>. It stands to reason, as we must be prepared to befriend anyone who comes our way. For those who are seeking to join our cause can apply at our headquarters, located at <strong>42 Somewhere 2nd Left</strong> in Rexbug, Idaho. Online applications are not available at this time, as we preffer to meet face to face, that's what friends do after all. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="our-customers">Our Customers</h3>
        <p>We are nothing without our customers, and so you are truely apart of who we are. To talk "about us" without talking about you would be only half our story. We are truely thankful to all those who have used our services, as it not only allows us the oppurtunity to bless your lives and the lives of those you send us to, be we are blessed by you in the process. Thank you. </p>
