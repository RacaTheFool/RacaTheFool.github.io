        <p>Interacting with others is actually healthy. Friends and family can be a determining factor in your overall health and happiness. After all, we are naturally social creatures. It's important not to try too hard and to be mindful of the personalities of those you are with: what may be funny or acceptable in one group can be irritating or awkward in another. But the flipside is that some groups will expect behavior that is unruly or uncouth, and you should never lower your standards in order to be accepted. So put yourself out there and meet new people, but never allow them to change you for the worse. </p>
