        <p>Are you human? Then you probably have problems. Problems can come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, and can (unfortunately) lead to thoughts of self doubt and depression. At <em>Friends and Fist-Bumps</em> we strongly believe that it's everyone has worth. Yes, that's right, we said <em><u><strong>everyone!</strong></u></em> One of the best ways to help others recognize this worth is through befriending them and spending quality time together. Our services are targeted towards helping others recognize their worth, make friends, and learn how to better interact with others. Below are a list of articles that touch on these points, as well as blogs written by those how have benefitted firsthand from our services. </p>
