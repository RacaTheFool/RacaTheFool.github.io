            <h2>Individual Worth</h2>
            <p>Everyone has worth. Period. Don't believe me? You can talk to me about Hitler, Genghis Khan, Stalin, and your ex-girlfriend/ex-boyfriend until your blue in the face, but everyone has worth. The reason why we see these others as monsters is because of how they treat others, by the fact that they have such a blatant disregard for the feelings and value of those whom they have hurt so badly. Really, these individuals are monsters because we know that everyone they have affected has that worth. </p>
        
            <p>This, of course, implies that you personally have worth. One problem is that we tend to get down on ourselves, and as a result become the monster in our own lives. You need to be okay with who you are, and this doesn't mean that you're perfect. We all make mistakes, but just like someone being patient and forgiving with another makes us look up to and respect that individual, we too can be patient and forgiving with ourselves. But just the same as that individual expects improvement and learning from the mistake, we must expect that from ourselves. </p>
    
            <p>Just remember that <em>you have worth!</em> Even as you wake up each morning to the trash heap your call your home, even when all you're friends have turned their back on you because you're such a jerk, just remember that we said, <strong><q>You have worth!</q></strong> </p>
